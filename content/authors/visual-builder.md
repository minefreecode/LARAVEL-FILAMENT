I started coding in 1983 on a ZX-81 and been a geeky coder ever since. 
Now focused on creating business automation tools with Laravel and Filament.
With Visual Builder my team and I are working on publishing a suite of tools that we've found essential when creating business apps.
We hope they will make creating apps faster and less repetitive and provide a better customer experience.
