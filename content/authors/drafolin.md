I'm a dragon who loves to code websites! 

I've discovered filament through my internship in 2024, and I've used it now and then when I needed an administration panel for my websites.

I will not be telling much more about myself, as I'm a dragon of few words (and it is easier to manage big bios in a single place). 
But if you want to know more about me, you can check out my [website](https://derg.ch) or follow me on the fediverse!
