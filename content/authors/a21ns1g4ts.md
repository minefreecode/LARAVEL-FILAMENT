Hello, my name is √Åtila. I am a software developer. I started my career 12 years ago working with Flash. Since then, I have been accumulating knowledge in the field of web development. Today, I consider myself an expert in Laravel, Livewire, PHP, as well as JavaScript, Vue.js, and Alpine.js. I have also worked extensively with TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Java, and C.
