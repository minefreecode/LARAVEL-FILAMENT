A full-stack developer from the United Kingdom. Full time developer since 2012 started out as a frontend developer 
and moved more into the backend now. Painfully remembers the says of supporting IE6 and needing to float everything.

I take pride in building quality code that’s super efficient and easy to maintain. 

I’m always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.
