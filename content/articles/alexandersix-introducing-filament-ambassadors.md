## We ðŸ’› the Filament Community

Filament has an incredible community that serves as the backbone of the project. Our members not only build incredible projects but, more importantly, support one another. This sense of collaboration and inclusivity is what makes Filament thrive. We are genuinely so lucky to count so many of you incredible developers among our ranks, and we are so excited to see the amazing things you do!

Among our already amazing community, we have noticed some stand-out members. If youâ€™ve been around the Filament community for any stretch of time, you likely might already have an idea of who weâ€™re talking about. There are some who have dedicated much of their time to creating helpful, instructional content, detailed descriptions, and game-changing packages, all while continuing to represent our community in the best way possible within Filament and out into the wider Laravel and PHP communities.

## Introducing the Filament Ambassadors Program

Because of the high quality representation that these members of our community have shown, the Filament team has decided to officially create a new Filament program: Filament Ambassadors.

This program is designed to recognize and support key members of the Filament community who have continually contributed back to the community through content, thought leadership, and overall advocacy of the project. Through this program, we will have the chance to work more closely with our Ambassadors to ensure that they are well-supported by us and have the tools they need in thanks for the monumental work that they are doing for the community.

With the launch of Filamentâ€™s Ambassador Program, we are so proud to announce the first cohort of Ambassadors:

## What to Expect from the Ambassadors

As a part of the Filament Ambassadors program, all Ambassadors agree to continue to be an active member of the Filament community in whatever way best suits their talents and contributions. They also agree
to continue to help make the Filament community a positive and inclusive environment for everyone. In return, we as the Filament core team will do whatever we can to help our Ambassadors carry on their work and reach their goals!
Our Ambassadors consistently put out high quality work, whether that's content, applications, plugins, etc., so we want to make sure we do our part to support them as much as we possibly can.

We have been so eager to find a way to work with these folks, and I can very easily say that we are beyond excited to partner with them to help them continue their incredible work into the future.
Please give our new Ambassadors a warm welcome in the Filament Discord or wherever else you can find them on the web!
